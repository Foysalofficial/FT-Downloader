## Using FT Downloader Library in your Android application

Add this in your `settings.gradle`:
```groovy
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
```

If you are using `settings.gradle.kts`, add the following:
```kotlin
maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }
```

Add this in your `build.gradle`
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.Foysalofficial:FT-Downloader:5.0'
```

If you are using `build.gradle.kts`, add the following:
```kotlin
implementation("com.github.Foysalofficial:FT-Downloader:5.0")
```

Do not forget to add internet permission in manifest if already not present
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
Then initialize it in onCreate() Method of application class :
```java
PRDownloader.initialize(getApplicationContext());
```
Initializing it with some customization
```java
// Enabling database for resume support even after the application is killed:
PRDownloaderConfig config = PRDownloaderConfig.newBuilder()
                .setDatabaseEnabled(true)
                .build();
PRDownloader.initialize(getApplicationContext(), config);

// Setting timeout globally for the download network requests:
PRDownloaderConfig config = PRDownloaderConfig.newBuilder()
                .setReadTimeout(30_000)
                .setConnectTimeout(30_000)
                .build();
PRDownloader.initialize(getApplicationContext(), config); 
```

### Make a download request
```java
int downloadId = PRDownloader.download(url, dirPath, fileName)
                        .build()
                        .setOnStartOrResumeListener(new OnStartOrResumeListener() {
                            @Override
                            public void onStartOrResume() {
                               
                            }
                        })
                        .setOnPauseListener(new OnPauseListener() {
                            @Override
                            public void onPause() {
                               
                            }
                        })
                        .setOnCancelListener(new OnCancelListener() {
                            @Override
                            public void onCancel() {
                                
                            }
                        })
                        .setOnProgressListener(new OnProgressListener() {
                            @Override
                            public void onProgress(Progress progress) {
                               
                            }
                        })
                        .start(new OnDownloadListener() {
                            @Override
                            public void onDownloadComplete() {
                               
                            }

                            @Override
                            public void onError(Error error) {
                               
                            }
                        });            
```

```

### Status of a download request
```java
Status status = PRDownloader.getStatus(downloadId);
```

### Clean up resumed files if database enabled

* Integration with other libraries like OkHttp, RxJava
* Test Cases
* And of course many many features and bug fixes
